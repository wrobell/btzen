Library to read data from Bluetooth Smart sensors.

Features

1. Devices and sensor readings

   - SensorTag (CC2541DK, CC2650STK)

     - temperature
     - pressure
     - humidity
     - light (CC2541DK only)

2. Sensor data access using `asyncio` coroutines.

Please update your sensor device to its latest firmware.

Run `bluetoothd` with `-E` option.

As root::

    $ hciconfig hci0 up
    $ hcitool lescan
    $ hcitool lecc <MAC>

To extend SensorTag battery life::

    $ hcitool lecup  --handle=<HANDLE> --min 6 --max 100 --timeout 1000 --latency 0

Please note, that above command will make single sensor read to last about
250ms. Therefore reading 4 sensors will take about 1s.

As an user::

    $ PYTHONPATH=. bin/btzen <MAC>

Requirements

- bluez 5.36
- Python 3.5
- Python D-Bus bindings
